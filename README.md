# GUESS ?
A two player guessing game !

## Description
The purpose of the game is for two people who want to test each other's knowledge of anything in the world. They can do this simply by selecting who will be the questioner and who will be the guesser. Just click on the 'Rules' button right under the title to see how the game works and how to start it. 

## Purpose for creation
This is a game I decided to create to continue practicing what I've been learning with JavaScript. The front-end isn't currently the best because my primary focus was on the game logic. However, I plan to keep updating and potentially adding new features to make it more fun and interactive. Feel free to contact me with any questions about my code. Criticism is welcomed!
